---------------------------------------------------
----- NEEDS TO BE DONE STILL (DUE 5/6 at 6AM) -----
---------------------------------------------------

- Either fix or nix the "pushing block" feature; it is not necessary and can be removed, but can be implemented into level design if it is polished if we want.
- More levels
- Functional camera
- Script to populate an area with spikes
- Basic walking animation
- Implement or remove the "Quit" button on menus

- Models still needed to be added to game
--- Spikes
--- Door (that opens when you get near it)
--- Lever
--- Gravity cube
--- Teleporter

- Sound implementation
--- Footsteps, jumping/landing, flipping gravity, clicking menu buttons, flipping lever, using teleporter, completing a level, dying
--- Sound for when a zone robot notices you, sound for when it gives up
--- Background music

- Attribution for spaceship model (idk how this works)
- Bake lighting at high quality
- Playtesting and bug fixing
